# Ping_Pong_Game
Pong Game using Turtle
A simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's turtle module.

#Description
This program implements the Pong game, where two players control paddles on either side of the screen to bounce a ball back and forth. The game keeps track of each player's score and updates it accordingly. The game runs in a Turtle graphics window and listens for keyboard inputs to control the paddles.

#How to Play
Run the Python script.
Player A uses the "W" key to move the paddle up and the "S" key to move the paddle down.
Player B uses the "Up Arrow" key to move the paddle up and the "Down Arrow" key to move the paddle down.
The ball will bounce off the paddles and the walls. The objective is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle and to score points when the opponent misses the ball.
Dependencies
This program uses the turtle module, which is a built-in graphics module in Python. No external dependencies are required.
